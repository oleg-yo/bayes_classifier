The family was at one time among the richest
in England, and the estates extended over the borders
into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in
the west. In the last century, however, four successive
heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,
and the family ruin was eventually completed
by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing
was left save a few acres of ground, and the twohundred-year-old
house, which is itself crushed
under a heavy mortgage.
